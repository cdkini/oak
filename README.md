# Oak ðŸŒ³

A simple CLI utility for developer notetaking. 


### Dependencies
Oak is a lightweight wrapper around `fd`, `rg`, `fzf`, `bat`, `monolith`, `html2markdown`, and `nvim`. 
It is written in Python 3.9 but has no dependencies.


### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cdkini/oak.git
cd oak
chmod +x oak
sudo cp oak /usr/local/bin # Or wherever you keep your scripts
```

You must also set your `OAK_ROOT` env var to point to a notes folder.
I like using `~/Dropbox` to keep things in sync between my machines.

### API
```bash
oak add <NAME> <TAGS?>          # Add new note
oak daily                       # Open daily note
oak delete <NAME?>              # Delete note
oak grep <QUERY?>               # Search notes (by contents)
oak find <QUERY?>               # Search notes (by title) 
oak fetch <URL> <NAME> <TAGS?>  # Convert a webpage into a note
oak list                        # List files (in reverse chronological order)
```
